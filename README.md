# dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfile configurations. This allows for a consistent experience across multiple computers.

I manage these configuration files using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]]. This allows me to set up symlinks for all dotfiles using a single command:

```bash
    stow .
```

## Installation

To clone this repo and its submodules, run the following command:

```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jacob-lineberry/dotfiles.git
```
